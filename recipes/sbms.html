    <h1>Stawberry Milkshake</h1>
    <p>Strawberry mlikshakes are a great treat, especially during the warmmer summer months like June and July. They are a great way to use up strawberries that are avout to go bad, or ones left in the freezer from when you tried to make jam last summer!</p>
    <p>To make a stawberry milkshake you will first need to gather a few supplies.
    <br><ul><li>3 cups vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen sliced stawberries</li>
        <li>1/2 milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whip cream(optional)</li>
        <li>A blender</li>
        <li>A large cup</li>    
    </ul>
    <br>Once all supplies have been gathered, we can begin making our treat. We do this by:
    <ol><li>Place the ice cream in the blender. Pour in the milk and strawberries.</li>
        <li>Blend on high until the ingredients are smooth and incorporated.</li>
        <li>Check for the deisired consistency. If your milkshake comes out too thick, add more milk. If your milkshake comes out too thin, simply more strawberries. Repeat until desired consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>Pour contents of the blender into your cup.</li>
        <li>Top with the optional whip cream and enjoy</li></ol>
